### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am software engineer from Zambia. Experienced with web application development in a few languages such as Java at an enterprise level, PHP casually. I am currently exploring modern web development with JavaScript. 

Am always looking for ways to improve my craft and I find practices such as TDD, pair programming as one of the many ways to get there. I participate in mob programming events with fellow software crafters and hope to contribute meaningfully from my unique background. 

Need a hand with one of your projects, please get in touch. I would be happy to help in anyway I can.
